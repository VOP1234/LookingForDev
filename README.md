## :computer: Project
For the back end, Node.JS was used with the help of the Insomnia tool, where routes were tested. We use the Github API and to store the data MongoDB.

For the front end we use React.JS. In it you have the possibility to register the user of GitHub putting your location. User data is on the right of the screen.
